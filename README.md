# CSS-Portfolio

## Description

This project was built from the ground-up to demonstrate the skills I've learned with CSS. It includes basic concepts such as selecting an aesthetic color palette to more advanced topics such as CSS flexbox, transitions and responsive design

I also tried to challenge my js skills in the permitted time frame, initially attempting to implement a basic testing suite built from the ground-up without relying on a pre-existing framework but realized a TDD (Test-Drive Development) approach was poorly suited to the assignment due to the brief timeframe and the nature of loosely defined requirements that comes with front-end projects

## Tests

As described above, a basic testing script was created for the project (found under test.js) that uses console.assert() to warn of certain bad practices. I may expand upon this later to be of more use for future project but currently it only runs smoke tests on a handful of IDs that would match semantic tags and warns if they aren't present
